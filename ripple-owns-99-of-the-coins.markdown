# Ripple owns 99% of the coins
    
Ripple is transparent about the XRP they possess in their quarterly reports.

Check [https://ledger.exposed](https://ledger.exposed/rich-stats) for live statistics about XRP distribution.

The **Top 100 accounts (wallets)** contain ~81% of the circulating XRP supply. Most of the wallets in the Top 100 are exchanges. The actual amount of XRP Ripple can spend not even close to 81%.

Regarding the 55 billion coins in escrow: Ripple [can't touch these coins and uses them to support market makers](https://fudbingo.com/ripple-can-flood-the-market-with-xrps).
