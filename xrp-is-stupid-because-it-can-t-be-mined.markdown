# XRP is stupid because it can't be mined
    
Unlike centralized mining pools for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, this consensus algorithm allows the network to be secured with a minimum of electrical power, and much more quickly, as we’ve seen.

#### XRP doesn't require mining
Because of its consensus algorithm, XRP doesn’t require centralized mining pools.  This allows its network to truly be decentralized in a way that supports the redundancy provided by a distributed system.  It also saves an exceptional amount of electrical energy, and is categorically better for the environment than Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Thanks to this, **the current XRP network fees are literally almost free**, transactions are distributed and **validated across the XRP ledger in a few seconds**, and the XRP ledger can handle 1500 transactions per second **on-ledger**!

Actually: not the miners, but electric companies benefit from crypto the most.
