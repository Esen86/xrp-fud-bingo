# Moon in 3, 2, 1: large USD tx on the ledger
    
One of the awesome features of the XRP Ledger is the "Decentralized Exchange". You can [issue your own IOU (I Owe You)](https://mobile.twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/997624135407714304): a token that can be exchanged using transactions on the XRP Ledger.

A large USD to USD transfer, from one XRPL account (wallet) to another, doesn't have to mean anything: as David Schwartz explains:

> Because the XRP Ledger is permissionless, anyone can use it to exchange assets, whether or not they have real value, with anyone else who agrees to accept them.
