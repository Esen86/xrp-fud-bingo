# XRP is a security
    
#### Highly unlikely. There's no ruling yet, but right now, XRP is not and it probably will not be in the future.

In US, a security includes an investment contract.  An investment contract has been defined by the Supreme Court as: 

1. an investment of money
2. in a common enterprise
3. with an expectation of profit
4. solely from the efforts of others

This definition of security captures most ICOs because the funds  raised from the ICO are pooled to develop the underlying tech or  software. It seems highly unlikely to capture xrp and the Ripple  Consensus Ledger (RCL). 

Taking each limb in turn:
1. Investment of money: People buy XRP. This is probably an "investment of money", but maybe not. Not every purchaser of XPR is an investor. If I buy XRP to send value quickly and cheaply my ownership might last all of three seconds. Is that an investment of money?
2. In a common enterprise: it is not clear that by buying XRP people are investing in a common enterprise. This definition is the least settled and most complicated area of the law. It's dealt with in more detail below, but it's irrelevant if the other tests aren't met.
3. Profit: some people buy XRP for profit. But some people want to send value quickly and cheaply, to send tips on twitter, or pay ledger fees. These diverse expectations probably mean the mere purchase of XRP can't constitute an investment contract (or common enterprise).
4.  Solely on others efforts - the value of XRP depends mostly but not solely "solely" on Ripple's efforts. Anyone can use the RCL: to create tokens, send value; ICO, day trade XRP at profit/loss wholly independent of Ripple's activities. So this limb appears unsatisfied.
