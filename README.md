# XRP FUD Bingo

### [https://fudbingo.com](https://fudbingo.com/)

There's a lof of FUD going around about XRP. To prevent the spreading of misinformation and to educate the [#XRPCommunity](https://twitter.com/search?q=xrpcommunity) is actively replying. **Because the [#XRPCommunity](https://twitter.com/search?q=xrpcommunity) rather spends time keeping up with the good news**, we curated the most common misunderstandings and FUD so we can just copy-paste links.

- You can use markdown in the description
- After the description, 3 dashes can be entered, whereafter you can add:

  - `tweet` with a link to a debunk-tweet, will be displayed below the description on the debunk detail page
  - `slug` will be auto-generated (and overwritten) based on the title
  - `id` empty for a new article, auto-generated for existing articles (to match when updating)
