# XRP used to be minable
    
In the early days people could **earn** (not mine) XRP by donating their computing power to research projects.

> Idle computers are the tools of do-gooders – thanks to World Community Grid (WCG), a program that pools computing power for researchers to use as they work to solve problems plaguing humanity. We love the program so we’re rewarding WCG participants with XRP!

> Here’s how it works: anyone with an Internet-connected device can participate. First, sign up for the WCG and create a Ripple account. When your computer is on but not in use, you donate your computing power to scientific projects. Available projects to donate computing power to include: curing cancer, fighting AIDS and finding clean energy sources.

> As you compute for good, you generate WCG points, redeemable for XRP.
