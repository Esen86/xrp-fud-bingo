# The XRP blockchain is centralised
    
There are many [validators already running](https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/validators). You can configure the validators to trust using a [Unique Node List](They are the lists of transaction validators a given participant believes will not conspire to defraud them.) (UNL).

- Everyone gets to choose who they trust.
- No one can be forced to trust anyone.
- Validators can't force others to trust them.

Regardless: everyone can run a `rippled` [node](https://github.com/WietseWind/docker-rippled) and/or [validator](https://github.com/WietseWind/docker-rippled) and introduce transactions: if the transaction is valid (signed, etc.) it's guaranteed to be included.

Ripple is working on [further decentralization](https://ripple.com/dev-blog/decentralization-strategy-update/).
